# Work Day Scheduler

## Summary

The Work Day Scheduler is deployed and ready to use.

### Webpage

* Current date is displayed at top of page.

* Time box color represents past (grey), present (red), and future (green).

* Fill your schedule by typing appointments or notes into the time boxes.

* Clicking the save button at the right of the time boxes will save the boxes' contents.

* Box contents are saved in local storage and will persist on page refresh.

### Code

* The time boxes are not in the HTML file, they are generated dynamically.

* Several lines in the HTML file were copied from DayJS documentation and are commented as such.

* I made no changes to the CSS starter code.

* Wrote Javascript from scratch. I used the DayJS and jQuery APIs for date/time manipulation and DOM traversal.

* Descriptive comments added to HTML and JavaScript files.
